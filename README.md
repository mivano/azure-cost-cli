[![NuGet Badge](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/azure-cost-cli)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/azure-cost-cli)
[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mivano/azure-cost-cli)](https://github.com/mivano/azure-cost-cli/releases/latest)
[![Latest build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/mivano/azure-cost-cli/dotnet.yml)](https://github.com/mivano/azure-cost-cli/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This is a simple command line tool to get the cost of your Azure subscription. It uses the Azure Cost Management API to get the cost and output the results to the console or JSON. E.g. so it can be used in a workflow to get the cost of your subscription and use it in subsequent steps.

## Installation

You can install this tool globally, using the dotnet tool command:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global azure-cost-cli 
```

## Upgrading

```bash
dotnet tool update --global azure-cost-cli 
```

With a `--version` parameter, you can specify a specific version to install. Use the `--no-cache` parameter to force a re-download of the package if it cannot find the latest version.

## Usage

You can invoke the tool using the `azure-cost` command. You can use the `--help` parameter to get a list of all available options.

```bash
azure-cost --help
```

Which will show:

```bash

        --skipHeader      Skip header creation for specific output formats. Useful when appending the output from multiple runs into one file. Defaults to false 

COMMANDS:
    accumulatedCost    Show the accumulated cost details
    costByResource     Show the cost details by resource
    budgets            Get the available budgets   

```

When you do not specify a subscription id, it will fetch the actively selected one of the `az cli` instead. 

> If the application is not working properly, you can use the `--debug` parameter to increase the logging verbosity and see more details.

> This tool uses the Azure Cost Management API to get the cost. Not all subscriptions have access to this API. To check if your subscription has access, you can use the `az account subscription show --subscription-id yourid --query '[subscriptionPolicies.quotaId]' -o tsv
` command. Validate the resulting quota id with the ones on the [Microsoft list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers) to see if it is supported. Running the tool with the `--debug` parameter will also show the quota id that is used.

> There is a pretty strict rate limit on the cost api; the calls are retried after a 429 is received, but it might take a while before the call succeeds as it honors the retry time out.

## Authentication

To make the call to the Azure cost API, you do need to run this from a user account with permissions to access the cost overview of the subscription. Further more, it needs to find the active credentials and it does so by using the `ChainedTokenCredential` provider which will look for the `az cli` token first. Make sure to run `az login` (with optionally the `--tenant` parameter) to make sure you have an active session.

## Use in a GitHub workflow

You can use this tool in a GitHub workflow to get the cost of your subscription and store the results in markdown as a Job Summary. This can be used to get a quick overview of the cost of your subscription.

```yaml
name: Azure Cost CLI Workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      az-subscription-id:
        description: 'Azure Subscription ID'
        required: true
jobs:
  run-azure-cost-cli:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Install Azure Cost CLI
        run: dotnet tool install -g azure-cost-cli

      - name: Run Azure Cost CLI
        run: azure-cost accumulatedCost -o markdown --subscription ${{ github.event.inputs.az-subscription-id }} >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

```

The last step output the markdown to the Job Summary. This can be used to show the cost of the subscription in the workflow summary. Use it on a schedule to get for example a daily overview. Alternatively you can use the `-o json` parameter to get the results in JSON format and use it for further processing.

## Commands

### Accumulated Cost

This will retrieve the accumulated cost of the subscription. This is the total cost of the subscription since the beginning of the period specified. We will try to fetch the forecast as well and organise by location, type and resource group. You can use the different formatters to get the results in different formats.

> This is the default command when you do not specify a command.

```bash
azure-cost accumulatedCost -s 574385a9-08e9-49fe-91a2-27660d92b8f5
```

### Cost By Resource

This will retrieve the cost of the subscription by resource. This will fetch the resource details including the meter information. It is up to the formatter how this is returned. Use the `json` formatter to get the full details.

```bash
azure-cost costByResource -s 574385a9-08e9-49fe-91a2-27660d92b8f5 -o json
```

### Budgets

This will retrieve the available budgets for the subscription. It will show the current status of the budget and the amount of the budget. As well as listing the configured notifications. 

```bash
azure-cost budgets -s 574385a9-08e9-49fe-91a2-27660d92b8f5 
```

## Query

Use the `--query` to specify a [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org) expression. This allows you to filter the results. For example, to get the yesterday cost of the subscription, you can use the following query:

```bash
azure-cost -s 574385a9-08e9-49fe-91a2-27660d92b8f5 -o json --query "totals.yesterdayCost"
```

Or to list only the resource groups:

```bash
azure-cost -s 574385a9-08e9-49fe-91a2-27660d92b8f5 -o json --query "ByResourceGroup[*].[ResourceGroup, Cost]"
```

will output:

```json
[["mindbyte-sand-api",28.94824],["rg-test",16.457219149662315],["rg-weu",0.252499694771765],["cloud-storage-westeu",0.183537445632]]
```

For the JMESPath parsing, it uses the [JMESPath.Net](https://github.com/jdevillard/JmesPath.Net) library. Not all constructions might be implemented yet. If you find a query that does not work, please open an issue with a reproducable path at their repo.

## Output formats

The tool supports multiple output formats. The default is `Console` which will output the results to the console. You can specify a different format using the `--output` parameter. The following formats are supported:

### Console

The default output format. It will output the results to the console in a graphical way.

![](screenshot.png)

### Json / JsonC

The Json format is great for further processing of the data. It will output the results in a JSON format to the console. Using the > operator, you can redirect the output to a file. Use `jsonc` to get a colorized output.

```bash
azure-cost accumulatedCost -s 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 -o json > cost.json
```

```json
